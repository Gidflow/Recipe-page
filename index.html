            <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First, peel the plantain and cut it into cubes. 
                        Peel and scrape the cassava, de-string it and also 
                        cut into cubes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, place the cassava and plantain into the blender. Add water: 
                        for now, use 350 ml (1 1/2 cups) if you want fufu to be firmer, or 450 ml 
                        (2 cups) if you prefer it softer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn the blender on and process the ingredients into a smooth paste.
                    Next, heat the paste in a saucepan over medium heat.
                     Stir constantly with a wooden spatula for 8 to 10 minutes 
                     to remove any lumps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now, add the remaining 50 ml (3 tbsp) of water to the mixture. 
                    Reduce the heat to the lowest setting, cover with a lid and steam for 
                    another 8 to 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After that, increase the heat to medium setting and stir. 
                     The fufu might look too soft, but it will become firmer as it cools down.
                     Transfer the fufu into a bowl and 
                     sprinkle one teaspoon of water on the surface to prevent forming a film. 
                     Let it cool completely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shape fufu into a ball and serve with soup or stew of your choice.
                </li>
            </ul>
